# Summary of Issue
The client requested for UNDAC Team Support and Logistics Manager to be able to manage finacial records for OSOCC. This involved being able to create and update a resources for each operation.

# Code Snippet
This is all the code snippet is due to various other team members already doing a lot of work with databases, making the task of adding new ways to store data a simple one liner. There is already methods created by others to fulfill the other tasks of the issue such as filtering resources.
```csharp
"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS operation_resource_request (Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, Name TEXT NOT NULL)",
```

# Any Code Changes Requested
There were no code changes requested during the review, most likely due to the simplicity of the code.

# Reflection
I think this week hasn't been great in terms of knowing what to actually work on. This is due to certain members taking it upon themselves to complete just about every task, which has left most of us with little code snippets, not really showcasing our full ability.
