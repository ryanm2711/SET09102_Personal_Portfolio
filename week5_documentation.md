## Six Rules of Clean Code

- **DIY (Don't repeat yourself):** No code is repeated, and only does one thing. For example some code in a function that is called in many areas of a system.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Code should be written as simple as possible, and the goal should not be to make the most complex piece of software with thousands of lines of code.
- **Readabiity over conciseness:** Other developers must be able to understand the code you write, and also for yourself to understand it later down the line.
- **YANGI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** Avoid functionality that will never be used, as this encourages clutter within software.
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** Inheriteance makes your code very unflexibile in later stages of modifications, unlike composition where the design types are according to functionality.
- **Practice:** Simply practice writing clean code, and with consistency comes with more clean code in the future.

This section is related to your work on clean code and documentation in week 5.

First, choose six rules of clean code and explain them. For each one,

* Summarise the rule in your own words.
* Provide an example from the code that you wrote in week 2 and then refined in week 4.
* Explain how your code implements the rule. 

Second, copy the doxygen comments from your code into your portfolio and provide some 
descriptive commentary on their purpose and structure. Use screenshots showing the HTML 
content that is generated from your code to illustrate your explanation.

Finally, highlight three examples from your code where you have eliminated the need
for comments by adhering to the principles of clean code.
