## Six Rules of Clean Code

- **DIY (Don't repeat yourself):** No code is repeated, and only does one thing. For example some code in a function that is called in many areas of a system.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Code should be written as simple as possible, and the goal should not be to make the most complex piece of software with thousands of lines of code.
- **Readabiity over conciseness:** Other developers must be able to understand the code you write, and also for yourself to understand it later down the line.
- **YANGI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** Avoid functionality that will never be used, as this encourages clutter within software.
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** Inheriteance makes your code very unflexibile in later stages of modifications, unlike composition where the design types are according to functionality.
- **Practice:** Simply practice writing clean code, and with consistency comes with more clean code in the future.
