# Transferring Teams
For most of this week I spent getting settled into the new Blue Team. A fresh new team starting from scratch, this is why the work done this week is just setup stuff.

# Setup
While others wrote other setup documents, I wrote the workflow the new team will be using. This workflow consists of two branches: **master** and **dev**. Here is a quick rough step-by-step of the workflow:
[A more in depth look at the workflow here](https://github.com/AloiSan/UndacBlue/blob/dev/Documentation/workflow.md)

<li>Pick out an issue and move it into the in progress tab on project board. Then assign yourself to issue</li>
<li>Create a new branch and name it <b>feature/#issue_number, have it based on the dev branch.</b></li>
<li>Once finished with your work, submit a pull request into <b>dev</b> branch. Once someone has reviewed it, commit the merge.</li>
<li>At the end of the week all the work in dev will be merged into master, this will keep the work consistent in dev but also avoid the issue of master being heavily outdated and causing confusion.</li>

# Reflection
Due to it being a new team the work at first will be slow, but I'm hopeful for it to ramp up next week after the discussion with our lecturer in the direction the blue team will be going. I feel that everyone is integrating into the new team well, with others getting the setup material done. Which should help for us to have a jump start at the real work next week.
