## Getting Settled In The Team

As a team we discussed on what the best way to communicate with one another and we eventually decided **Discord** would be best option as it's quick & easy, and everyone was already familiar with it.
We got setup on that and have used that for a hub for any questions regarding the project - or if anyone needs additional support they can ask on there.

## Setting Up My Personal Environment

### Installing MAUI Into Visual Studio
Luckily, I already had Visual Studio 2022 installed. However, I did not have the **MAUI** package that we would be using for this project. It was a fairly straightforward process installing it as I opened the **Visual Studio Installer** program and clicked **Modify** on my current installation. Then scrolling down I saw **MAUI** was already supported, so I just simply ticked and clicked **Install**.


In the following image this is what the **MAUI** tile should look like before clicking **Install**. The checkbox on the right determines whether or not it will include the component in the visual studio installation. In this case ticking is what we want.

After that I let **Visual Studio Installer** do it's thing.

### Determining Whether MAUI Installed Correctly
Now I've got Visual Studio 2022 with **MAUI** installed with it, I've got templates available to me now that I never had previously.

In this image you can see all the new templates that come with MAUI:
